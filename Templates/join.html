<h3>TRANSITIONING TO A NEW OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE</h3>
<p>Ross &amp; Yerger Insurance (R&amp;Y) joined Intersure in 2000. A year later, the owner decided to sell the fourth generation, family-owned agency in Jackson, Mississippi. To <strong>prevent acquisition by a national broker,</strong> a group of executives purchased R&amp;Y via an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Their first order of business was to create a perpetuation plan that would keep the business thriving in the next generation. In 2001, R&amp;Y had roughly 45 employees, $7.5M in revenues and $5M of corporate debt.</p>
<p>With the help of several Intersure partners and national consultants, <strong>R&amp;Y began developing an internal perpetuation program</strong>, which is now referred to as its Future Partners Group (FPG). Several ideas that spawned from the Intersure relationships included:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>limiting ownership for any one producer to 15% to relieve cash flow pressure if retiring one or several large books of business at a given time</li>
<li>implementing a formula whereby a given producer’s ownership is “reallocated” periodically according to his/her “contribution” to the agency’s book of business</li>
<li>setting appropriate levels of compensation for new and renewal business</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">“ We’re all about staying independent, which not many in our peer group can say these days. Thanks to Intersure, we’ve built an agency perpetuation plan that will keep us that way.”</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #f6a11c;"><strong>Dudley Wooley, CEO/COO | Ross &amp; Yerger</strong></span></p>
<p>By the end of 2012, R&amp;Y had grown to 95 employees and $18.5M in revenues. This was achieved with <strong>100% organic growth post acquisition</strong>. The agency has a success rate of 65% among all producers hired into the FPG program and is recognized as a Best Place to Work by MS Business Journal and Business Insurance, as well as a “Top 3 Commercial Insurance Agency” by National Underwriter. R&amp;Y attributes a great deal of its success to the many personal and professional relationships developed with Intersure partners.</p>
